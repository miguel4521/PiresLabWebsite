                    sequencing, are providing a paradigm shift in genetics research. New organisms can now be adopted
                    with
                    relatively little effort to complement the more established genetics model systems. We study
                    nematodes of the genus <em>Auanema</em>, which produce males, females and hermaphrodites. The nematode <em>C. elegans </em> is used as a reference.
